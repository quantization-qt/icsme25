def check_scenario(scenario: str, liar_count: set, statements: dict, days_of_week: set) -> bool:
    """
    Evaluates the consistency of a scenario where one participant is the criminal based on the given statements.

    This function takes a potential criminal's name (scenario) and a set of liars (liar_count) and checks if
    the statements made by all participants are consistent with this scenario, disregarding any statements
    about the day of the week.

    Parameters:
    - scenario (str): The name of the participant being tested as the potential criminal.
    - liar_count (set): A set of names of participants who are assumed to be liars.
    - statements (dict): A dictionary mapping participant names to lists of their respective statements.
    - days_of_week (set): A set of strings representing the days of the week.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the scenario is consistent with the statements, False otherwise.

    Test Cases:
    >>> check_scenario("ALICE", {"BOB", "CHARLIE"}, {"ALICE": ["I am guilty."], "BOB": ["ALICE is not guilty."], "CHARLIE": []}, {"MONDAY", "TUESDAY"})
    True

        Evaluates the consistency of a statement made by a participant.

        This helper function takes a statement, the number of liars, the scenario, and the statements of all participants,

        Parameters:
        - statement (str): The statement made by the participant.
        - liar_count (set): A set of names of participants who are assumed to be liars.
